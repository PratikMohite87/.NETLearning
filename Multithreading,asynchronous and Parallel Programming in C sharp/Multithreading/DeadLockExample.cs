       Scenario when a deadlock can occur
       Let's say we have 2 threads 
            a) Thread 1
            b) Thread 2

       and 2 resources
            a) Resource 1
            b) Resource 2

       Thread 1 has already acquired a lock on Resource 1 and wants to acquire a lock on Resource 2. 
       At the same time Thread 2 has already acquired a lock on Resource 2 and wants to acquire a lock on Resource 1. 
       Two threads never give up their locks, hence a deadlock.

       Take lock at image in folder.

When to use Task ?

	Task.Wait is a blcking call.
	It blocks the thread until the task is complete, and ignores all other operations while you are waiting 
		for task completion.
	By default, the task runs on a thread pool.
	If ypu are will to block user interaction or ignore the other operations, its better to use Task.

When to use Async-Await ?

	Async Await feature simplifies the asynchronous call.
	It keeps processing the main thread, which means not blocking the main thread, & allows you to process the
		other operations in the queue.
	If you are willing to allow your application to do some other operations until the main task completion, 
		you can use async await.
